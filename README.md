# Project A.M.A.N.

**Project AMAN** is our final project for our DSA Class.

AMAN stands for Automated Movie Actor Nexus and its name inspired by our great professor Amanpreet 

Given any two actors,
AMAN will find the shortest path between them using common movies.

This project was built using **Python**, **IMDBpy**, and **BeautifulSoup**. In it, we also implemented both BFS and Dykstra's algorithm in order to test efficiencies and differences between the two algorithms for our school project.

Fork the repository and try it out for yourself.

We hope you enjoy it!
